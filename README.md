I wanted to create my own programming language. I also wanted to learn Ruby. So, I decided to kill two birds with one stone and build a language using Ruby.

I didn’t know where to start, then I stumbled upon Marijn Haverbeke’s implementation of Egg language in javascript. 

I began by translating the parser, evaluator, etc. from JS to Ruby and added new functionality and syntax along the way. For the things that didn’t transfer well, I changed them to better suit my needs.

This was a lot of fun and I’m happy with how it’s turning out. I learned a lot about Ruby and the inner workings of languages in general. But there’s still much work to be done!

Virtually any computation was allowed in the original javascript implementation, however it was purposely intended to be a small, uncomplicated language. As such, many familiar operations, even mathematically simple things like negative numbers, are missing. 

In continuing this project, I want to add those modern functionalities present in today’s most popular languages. I’ll sporadically update this page with batch code changes.
